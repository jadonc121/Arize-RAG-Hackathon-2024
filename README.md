# Arize-RAG-Hackathon-2024

Arize Hackathon 2024 - RAG LLM Project

Objective:

Create a RAG-LLM project that can read and interpret math content. LLMs are not primarily designed to be good at math. This project experiments with how a RAG performs when the external data sources are math textbooks. Can it generate mathematically logical results? Two categories of queries are given: theoretical/conceptual questions and hard math questions (e.g., calculations, functions). 

Instrumented using LangChain. Tracing and evals initially submitted to Arize Phoenix. Then tracing submitted to Arize. Evals in Arize and dockerized app with UI to come.
